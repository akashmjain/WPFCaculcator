Basic GUI Calculator written in WPF. this is my first day of learning WPF so there can be mistakes in coding styles.
get calcualtor .exe file [here](https://github.com/akashmjain/WPFCaculcator/blob/main/Executable/Calculator.exe) or generate your own if you want by opening project in visual Studio and Building the project.
